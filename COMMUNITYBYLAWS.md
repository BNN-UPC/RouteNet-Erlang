## Community by-laws

RouteNet-Erlang is a pioneering GNN architecture designed to model computer networks. RouteNet-Erlang supports complex 
traffic models, multi-queue scheduling policies, routing policies and can provide accurate estimates in networks not 
seen in the training phase.

### Community Roles

Participants in the project can assume the following roles:

**User:** someone using the framework code, who contributes by helping
other users on the mailing lists, reporting bugs or suggesting
features.

**Developer:** a user active in discussions on the developer mailing
list, contributing to the source code, the examples library, or
documentation. Their contributions are added to the source tree by a
committer.

**Committer:** a developer with write access to the source code
repository. Commit access is granted by the Project Management
Committee.

**Project Management Committee (PMC) member:** PMC members control the
direction of the project, based on consensus. The PMC sets the
priorities for the features to be developed, grants and revokes commit
access, and decides what can and cannot be merged into the source tree.

### Project Management Committee

The first PMC was established at the time of the open-sourcing of the
initial code and will govern the project. The project has been kick-started 
at BNN, UPC, and the PMC memberships reflect this. During the first years, 
the goal of the PMC is to engage with the community, disseminate the model 
and incorporate members from other contributing organizations. After a while,
a PMC based on merit in contributions and demonstration of commitment to the
project will be elected by the committers, from the committers. The
exact procedures will be discussed on the developer mailing list, and
this document will be updated to reflect the outcome of those
discussions when the PMC feels that consensus is reached.

The current members of the PMC are:
-  Miquel Ferriol-Galmés (miquel.ferriol@upc.edu)
-  José Suárez-Varela (jose-rafael.suarez-varela@upc.edu)
-  Albert Cabellos-Aparicio (alberto.cabellos@upc.edu)
-  Pere Barlet-Ros (pbarlet@ac.upc.edu)
