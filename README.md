# RouteNet-Erlang

This is the official implementation of RouteNet-Erlang, a pioneering GNN architecture designed to model computer 
networks. RouteNet-Erlang supports complex traffic models, multi-queue scheduling policies, routing policies and 
can provide accurate estimates in networks not seen in the training phase.

## Quick Start
### Dependencies

**Recommended: Python 3.7**

Please, ensure you use Python 3.7. Otherwise, we do not guarantee the correct installation of dependencies.

You can install all the dependencies by running the following commands.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Datasets

### Tutorial
To get started with *IGNNITION*, we have prepared a step-by-step tutorial that explains in detail how to design a basic GNN from scratch.
Click [here to start this tutorial](https://ignnition.org/doc/quick_tutorial/).

After this tutorial, you should be prepared to:
- Start designing [your own GNN model from scratch](https://ignnition.org/doc/intro/).
- Reuse any model from our [examples library](https://ignnition.org/doc/examples/) and adapt it to your needs.

Please, follow the [documentation](https://ignnition.org/doc/) to know all the details of this framework.
